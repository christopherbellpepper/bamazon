# bamazon
an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. 

The App starts out listing the inventory with prices.  The user is then prompted to enter the item ID # followed by the quantity they'd like to purchase.  If available, the app will allow the user to "complete the purchase."  Otherwise, the app will alert an "insufficient quantity available" message.

Once an order is placed, the inventory is updated in the MySQL database...
